# Chess Game

This project is a real-time, multiplayer chess game built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Chess.js. It allows two players to connect and play a game of chess against each other in a web browser.

## Code Explanation

The application is structured into several key files:

- `app.js`: This is the main server-side file. It sets up the Express server, handles static file serving, configures Socket.IO for real-time communication, and manages the chess game logic using the Chess.js library.
- `public/css/style.css`: This file contains the CSS for styling the chessboard, squares, and pieces. It ensures the board is visually appealing and responsive.
- `public/js/chessgame.js`: This client-side JavaScript file handles the rendering of the chessboard, drag-and-drop functionality for pieces, and communication with the server via Socket.IO. It uses the Chess.js library to manage game state on the client.
- `views/index.ejs`: This EJS template file defines the structure of the main game page, including the chessboard container and links to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

- `app.js`: Main server file.
- `package.json`: Defines project metadata and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.
  - `public/css/`: Contains CSS stylesheets.
    - `style.css`: Custom styles for the chess game.
  - `public/js/`: Contains client-side JavaScript files.
    - `chessgame.js`: Client-side game logic and rendering.
- `views/`: Contains EJS template files.
  - `index.ejs`: The main HTML template for the game.

## How to Run or Deploy the Project

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd chess
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

4.  **Access the game:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Dependencies and Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
-   **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
-   **Socket.IO**: Library for real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication.
-   **Chess.js**: JavaScript library for chess move generation, validation, and game state tracking.
-   **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating.
-   **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Examples

Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:3000` in two different browser tabs or windows to simulate two players. Each player will be assigned a role (white or black), and you can start playing chess by dragging and dropping pieces.
